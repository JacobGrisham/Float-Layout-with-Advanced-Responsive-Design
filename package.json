To run the script type the following in the terminal: npm run build:css. Note that you must keep this running in order for it to work. The second command line to run in the terminal while in the starter folder is the following: live-server. This creates an http of the webpage. Again, you must keep this running in order for it to work. The next thing to discuss in the build process. Each of the scripts below is a step in the process of building css...",
