// CLEARFIX HACK // 
@mixin clearfix {
  &::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
  }
}
// We use clearfix because when we float our columns to the left, the height becomes 0. The clearfix appends the pseudo-element ::after. For clearfix to work, we need to define content (even though we don't have any to input, we need to display it as a table, and we need to clear both the right and left margin. //

  // Note that ems and rems are not affected by the root settings in media queries. For example, ems and rems are not affected by html{font-size: 62.5%;}. We will use ems instead of rems since rems fail to work in some of the browsers. Also note that we are not using pixels due to accessibility. Recall that some users increase (or decrease) the font-size, so we shouldn't use pixels because it won't scale correctly. Another note: for best practices, we should include only screen. That way, it someone wants to print the page, it'll be full size//
